\chapter{Basic concepts}
\label{chap:basic-concepts}

In this chapter, we will introduce DortDB, the software that was written as a part of this thesis. DortDB is a TypeScript framework for querying existing in-memory data. It aims to be as configurable and modular as possible. It does not come with any query language by default -- the languages come in the form of plugins. Each language can then use the same already present building blocks, including a query optimizer or secondary indices. DortDB supports combining multiple languages in a single query, a concept more elaborated in chapter \ref{chap:multilang-queries}. We have already implemented three languages: SQL, XQuery, and Cypher. DortDB offers freedom in querying any kind of data using any kind of language, as long as a suitable data adapter is provided. DortDB will be released as an open-source library on NPM\footnote{\url{https://www.npmjs.com/}} (Node.js package manager).

Additionally, we have developed a graphical user interface for DortDB. It can be used to experiment with query optimizer strategies, inspect logical query plans, or query data.
